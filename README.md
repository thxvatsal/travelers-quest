## Project Overview

# Traveler's Quest

`Traveler's Quest` is a project that adds a digital proof as a sign of a memory of being in that place. We have NFTs available and can only be minted if you are in that particular place and the way we do it is by having the geolocation value.
Traveling has always been fascinating and a fun adventure to have and now with traveler quest's feature we could also add capabilities of private access communities and much more that comes with integration of NFTs.

If you have any question or suggestion regarding our project. Consider joining our [Discord](https://discord.gg/gB3Bkzrh)!

## Project Building Tools ⚒️

### Polygon

Polygon is a “layer two” or “sidechain” scaling solution that runs alongside the Ethereum blockchain — allowing for speedy transactions and low fees. MATIC is the network’s native cryptocurrency, which is used for fees, staking, and more. You can buy or sell MATIC via exchanges like Coinbase. 


### Alchemy NFT API
Alchemy and their NFT API have been critical in bringing Web 3.0 to our creative community here at Behance. Their simple unified APIs abstract away some of the complexities of blockchain technology and helped us move faster.


### IPFS
IPFS is a permanent and a decentralized storage network designed to store data.

Our project uses IPFS for storing the data of an NFT. Which means the NFT data is parmanent and can't be deleted. Minted NFT's can also be seen on opensea by clicking on link under your minted NFT card.

### Solidity Smart Contract
We built our own smart contract for storing our metadata URL's from IPFS, Since we want our project to be completely decentralized.

Our smart contract is deployed on the Polygon Mumbai Network.
